# LivingStream, an Interactive Projection

LivingStream is an Unity application that uses a projector to display a river with local fish. The application is configured to accept object tracking to allow interaction with the projection. The tracked object data ID and (x, y, z coordinates) is received via UDP from LivingStream-python.

This application is part of the larger **LivingStream project**. The project was created in coordination with the University of Texas at Arlington and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for education and entertainment at one of their visitor's centers.
